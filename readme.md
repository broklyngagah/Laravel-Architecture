Laravel-Architecture
====================

Experimenting with code Architecture in Laravel

## To Do
1. Repository with Factories
2. Move sql methods to Eloquent models from Repo (cleaner, but not necessarily necessary)
3. Keep cache in Repo
4. Extend collection for own Paginator and create or steal paginator interface. (Compose Laravel Paginator into extended class to do logic). Ability to set page manually, take Input class out of it.
